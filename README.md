# 📊 Student Engagement Data Analysis

This project analyzes student engagement data across 2021 and 2022 from a learning platform. The focus is on measuring usage (in minutes watched) across free and paid plans and among different countries (notably the US and India).

## 🎯 Objective

To identify engagement trends, measure differences in engagement by plan type and country, and draw data-driven insights using descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing.

## 🔍 Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Descriptive Statistics
- Calculated mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and quartiles for minutes watched across years and plan types.

### Task 2: Comparing Free vs Paid Plan Engagement
- Performed a two-sample t-test assuming unequal variances.
- Found statistically significant difference in engagement between free and paid students.

### Task 3: Hypothesis Testing - US vs India (2022, Free Plan Students)
- Performed F-test for variances and two-sample t-test assuming unequal variances.
- Found **no statistically significant difference** in engagement between US and India (p-value > 0.05).
